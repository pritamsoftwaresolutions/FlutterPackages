# CodeWithAndrea Flutter Packages

A collection of packages, created to increase code reuse across many of my Flutter projects.

They include:
 
- Wrappers for FirebaseAuth and Firestore
- Small UI widgets (dialogs, buttons, etc)
- Larger UI widgets (email & password authentication etc)

NOTE: The author will only maintain these packages for his own internal projects. They will **not** be published on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) 

and while you're free to use them, they're not meant to be a community project.

Breaking changes may be introduced at any time.
